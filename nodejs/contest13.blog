    <p>I decided NOT to write an overwhelmingly long blog post, instead I'll just summarize my verbal evaluation (as best as I remember it). On the bottom of this blog post are my notes that I wrote during the target speech:</p>
    <p>The target speaker was a lovely lady named Rose. Her speech title was “Ace It.” She spoke about the sales process and how it relates (or can be applied to) a job interview. Here is my verbal evaluation (from what I can recall, haha).</p>

              <li>my parents were able to make it. They were in the audience at the time.</li>
              <li>in her speech, Rose told us to say a phrase at the end of a job interview: “Before we part ways, I'd like to tell you ... (something)(something)</li>
              <li>I had my notes in my hand, but they were rolled up and I never even glanced at them! I only looked down to remember the speaker's quote above.</li>

        <p>“Welcome, Toastmasters, honored guests and my mommy & daddy. [laughs] Thank you, Rose, for sharing your experience with us about the sales process and how we can apply it to a job interview. Your advice was so good that I'm going to use it right now. Like a good sales person, I'm going to make you like me by telling you three things that you did well. I'll then sell you on three pieces of advice that I will convince you that you need.</p>
        <p>First, you established yourself upfront. How can we trust you? Well, you answered that question by telling us that you're an HR professional and a coach. This way, we know that the advice you're about to give is valid. Second, the information you gave us is tangible and relatable. Not only can it be applied to a job interview, it can be applied to our personal lives. For example, we learned how to make someone else like us. I'm going to take that advice, go home and immediately apply it to my wife. [laughs]
        </p>
        <p>Third, your speech mechanisms were all there. You had vocal variety, gestures, good speech cadence with well placed pauses. You spoke with crisp precision. Well done!</p>
        <p>Now, here's some advice to elevate your speech to the next level. First, you gave us advice to tell a personal story to get someone to like us. Well, I would like to turn this same advice over to you. If you tell us a personal story about why you got into HR and interested in the process upfront, that would help to establish a human connection with your audience. Tell us about your first interview. If you don't have a story, make one up. [laughs] I make up stuff every time my wife asks me a question. [laughs]
        </p>
        <p>Second, you had a lot of really good information. But at times, I felt it was information overload. I would suggest that you have a hand out with explicit takes ways that you want the audience to remember. Third, the title of your speech was “Ace It.” You used it in the intro and again in the conclusion. I would recommend that you make “Ace It” your speech mantra, and sprinkle the phrase throughout your speech.</p>

        <p>Before we part ways, I'd like to tell you about .... how I admire your speaking ability. You spoke with confidence, were very organized, had really good speech mechanics and I congratulate you on a job well done.”</p>
        <p>I ended just after 3 minutes (I would estimate 3 min 10 seconds). When I finished my evaluation content, I was at the yellow flag. So I figured I had some leeway to come up with a decent conclusion and a summary to wrap everything up.
        </p>
        <p>Interesting note on some of the other evaluators: I was speaking order #4 (which I was really excited about, it's a good number to have chosen). The guy next to me, during the target speaker's speech, had used TWO sheets of paper for his notes!!! I was very surprised. He was writing A LOT during the speech. When he went up there, it was somewhat amusing to see him fumble through his two sheets of notes to find more advice for the speaker. The lesson that I learned is that less is more. My notes were pretty succinct, I even finished marking them up before the 5 minute time limit we were given. Also, in the room where they put us while we finish our evaluation, *many* people were just having idle chats with each other. I, on the other hand, was pacing back & forth and planning out my speech (which removed my dependency on the notes during my evaluation -- yay!).</p>
        <p>It was a very good and humbling experience. I feel very humbled and proud of the progress I made with giving an effective evaluation. Me with my parents at the contest:</p>
