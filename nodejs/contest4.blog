<p class="excert">An honest critique of my performance from a trust
audience member.</p>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<div class="quotes">I'm just going to be brutally honest about
everything, which I believe you'll appreciate... at least in the
long run. So yeah, to start off - I know of 3 judges who all listed
the order that won (colin 1, you 2, whatever 3) - so it probably
wasn't a judging fluke.<br>
<br>
The main problem was that Colin killed it. Personally I thought his
jokes were hilarious, his writing was very good, and his delivery
was virtually flawless. And he even pulled a Paul, and
semi-condescendingly referenced your speech in his. A little extra
vocal variety he could've used, but his wasn't even too bad. Yours
was a bit better, sure.<br>
<br>
You did mess up, and I was sad to see that. Your recovery was
quick, obviously infinitely better than #3 dude (not a good
comparison, I know). But it was a solid stumble, which
unfortunately you didn't even do in your last performance. I've
noticed sometimes we don't do our best at later rounds in the
contest, for a multitude of reasons, and well, f*, that's just
life. But you likely did lose some significant points for that. You
had a big throat clearing and restart, that I noticed. And I've
noticed at division/district level most people don't have delivery
lapses, and still get owned. Delivery is expected to be perfect.
Can we do anything about that... I don't know. I think the stress
of competing seriously is necessary for our growth so we're just
forced to work through those kind of mishaps in the long-run.
Sometimes you get one shot, one opportunity, for everything you
ever wanted... and you f* up (a bit). But the truth is in the long
run there's never just one shot.<br>
<br>
Your general expressiveness was a bit better, I like how you can
make very big facial expressions, smile with your eyes, and have
very animated hand movements. But I do remember feeling like you
were a bit nervous this time around. Maybe it's an effect of seeing
your speech a second time, or maybe I'm right, but I feel like your
delivery was a bit muted/rushed, like you were a bit more nervous
at some level. You did get in right before time limit, so maybe the
rushing was a necessity...<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's all relative. And I think perhaps concretely Colin's
punchlines were a bit more hard-hitting. A lot of your jokes were
cute, credit-score and financial stability related and what not,
whereas I might say Colin had some well structured jokes, like
"crying? what was there to cry about" [after being born].<br>
<br>
As someone that's studied comedy a little bit, it's hard to
describe, but I'm theorizing here for your potential benefit...
it's like, his comedic conceit was a little more deeply developed.
Like he went hardcore into the narcissism for his comic
perspective, and didn't hold back. Your jokes about meeting your
wife and talking to the computer were pretty soft and gentle.
Here's a controversial saying I think is probably true: comedy is
about truth and pain. When Colin talks like a cocky asshole,
there's a greater "pain", he's more insulting to the audience, but
we know he's joking so the audience is on board. When you talk
about the mildly nuanced annoyances of marriage, it's funny, most
of the audience can related, but it's less stimulating and
memorable. (Again, all relative. Your speech was obviously still
very funny in absolute terms) Like... you could've been more edgy
in what you were saying about your own flaws, or the pains of
marriage. Higher risk approach, but higher potential reward.<br>
<br>
With your Obama speech... you did go a little deeper. You were kind
of implying Biden/Obama were really bizarre people with their pie
obsessions, and the theatrics really brought it all together
pleasantly. So you were lacking those competitive edges this
time.<br>
<br>
In the end, it's hard to compare speeches, especially good ones.
It's kind of a bullshit process, not really a naturally competitive
domain. Competitive public speaking shouldn't really be a valid
life pursuit, for that reason IMO.<br>
<br>
Hope I'm not being harsh here, I just figure you can use some very
tough love after an experience like this. I know I liked it when
people dove in when I lost, even to the detriment of my ego. Let me
know if any of this was helpful, or if I can expound any more.<br>
