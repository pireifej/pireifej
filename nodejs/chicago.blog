      <p>It was, as you can imagine, a very good experience. Actually, one of the people Iʼve been corresponding with about the event is some director at AT&amp;T (had no idea!) and even he gave me very
	positive feedback and told me that others at the conference had very positive feedback as well. Obviously, my manager was kept in the loop with the feedback and thus, my plan to get a window office is resumed. Hahahahahaha. That's right!! I did all of this just to get a window office. It wonʼt happen, but I keep trying^</p>

	  <p>Flying to Chicago was eventful, in a bad way. My original flight was canceled on Monday morning and rescheduled to late afternoon from LaGuardia. Not sure if you've ever been to that airport but getting there is pretty horrendous. I was already in Newark airport when I learned about the change. I'm glad tht AT&amp;T pays for the transportation, I was using Lyft to get everywhere (very convenient way to travel, BTW!).</p>
	  <p>When I got to Chicago finally, I was pretty exhausted. You would think that my nights in Chicago would be super pleasant, what with all the non-crying from my kids. But I woke up at around 2 AM to a weird, very loud, hum noise. Not sure if it was coming from outside or in the hotel, but it was definitely disruptive. And then I couldnʼt go back to sleep. So I went out to some office area on the same floor and did some work and reviewed my slides for the presentation the next day. I visited the conference room where I would be speaking (pictures taken at around 2:30 AM):</p>

	  <p>I was a little disappointed at first because the room didnʼt seem to havea large capacity, and I expected like a thousand people there (hahaha). But itʼs good enough to the point where I would getscared. They also already had the soda laid out, so it was nice to know Iʼd be able to drink very unhealthy things that evening.
	  </p>
	  <p>I eventually went back to sleep but weʼre talking about the weehours of the morning at this point. I guess Iʼm getting used togiving speeches on very little sleep. Itʼs not like I could sleepduring the actual conference itself (I was sitting through other peopleʼs presentation). So, about an hour and a half before mypresentation it finally dawns on me,"Hey, this is it. Instead of listening to people�s talks, Iʼd be doing one of my own. It wreally cool to listen to other peopleʼs presentation styles. Iremember two in particular who seemed nervous, which in turn made me feel better about myself. One gentleman (actually ran into him in the hotel lobby later that night) just looked directly into his laptop screen the entire time. He never made eye contact and had many filler words. Another young lady, who admitted she was nervous, looked back at her slides a lot and had quite a few filler words; Iʼd almost say every other word. She also spoke very quietlyand had trouble when handling the QA part.</p>
	  <p>There was an AI presentation that was supposed to happen just before my own. The speaker wasnʼt there so they moved onto me! Myheart skipped many beats. They did not read my introduction (which I emailed them a while back) and just called me up. The host naturally pronounced my name wrong even though he confirmed the pronunciation with me moments before (and got it right that time).</p>
	  <p>While I was sitting at my table, there was a very nice English gentleman named Richard who flew there all the way from .. uhh... I dunno, Europe? Britain? Some English country; my geography isnʼtvery good. Nor is my intellect. Or general knowledge of things.LOL. He was actually very pleasant to speak with (maybe because of his lovely accent). Heʼs married and has two daughters who are inhigh school so we related to each other in a way. Anyway, he joked with me and I then subsequently stole both jokes to use as an ice breaker during my presentation (more on that later). He commented on the title of my presentation "Steps to Manage a Successful Fraud System Migration" and said something like, "Oh, Iʼm glad it wassuccessful And he made another comment about how they have happy hour just after my presentation (mine was the last on the agenda before the evening events).</p>
	  <p>I felt pretty gosh darn nervous. I was snacking on a pretzel they had maybe an hour before I got up. I wasnʼt hungry but it waslate in the afternoon/early evening and I knew I should put something in my belly so I donʼt pass out. When I got up, the hos confirmed he has the right slides up. He set me up with the microphone (it was one that just clipped onto my suit jacket which was great). It reminded me of doing the district speech contest for Toastmasters - haha. The one thing I forgot when I got up to the podium was my phone. They didnʼt have a timer like in Toastmastersso I had meant to pace myself. I didnʼt really know how long I did,if I was too short and or went too long, I just had to rely on my practice runs at our club which isnʼt precise.</p>

	    <p>So, I opened with jokes!!! And they laughed!!! This was after sitting through talks all day, so Iʼm glad I could quickly connectwith the audience right off the bat. The host introduced me a little bit by saying Iʼm from AT&amp;T. So I started by asking,just out of curiosity, how many people in the audience (by a show of hands) are using ATT as their network provider. After they raised their hands, I said, "Oh, Iʼm so sorry to hear hat. Iʼd asyou to mute your phones but if you got a call it wouldnʼt go throuanyway." That got a lot of laughs. Itʼs a reliable joke because Iused it when I chaired the Toastmasters Area 62 contest. Yay.</p>
	    <p>I also mentioned that Iʼm the only thing standing etween all ofyou and happy hour so Iʼll try to make this presentation painless.That also got laughs. When I got to the presentation title, I emphasized that the migration was successful. If it wasnʼt, Iwouldnʼt be up there speaking to them. That got some chuckle</p>
	    <p>Anyway, I definitely got things off to a good start, with some help from my new friend Richard. I went to the slide (I think you saw it) with the quote and all of the hands on top of each other. I really liked the way I introduced the quote and I read it out loud this time (I donʼt think I did it at our club). I joked and toldthem this is the only important slide of the presentation so they can go back to checking email and playing games on their phone (that also got laughs). I told them that a system migration shouldnʼt be viewed just as getting rid of the old system, butrather as teamwork and working with the new system to expand it and build upon it. It was a good way to introduce a boring topic. Haha.</p>
	    <p>The rest of the presentation was pretty much autopilot, just based on my practice runs at my home Toastmasters club. I honestly didnʼt really review it that much (or even do practice runs) since my practice. The last two slides I feel I fumbled because I didnʼtpractice it at my club. It really goes to show how important Toastmasters is as a platform to run through these things. It helps on so many levels.</p>
	    <p>The Q&amp;A was by far my favorite part (aside from getting laughs). Itʼs REALLY cool to listen to the audienceʼs feedbacthrough their questions. When people asked questions, I walked towards them like politicians do at town halls. I really felt like I connected with the audience, it feels very special. They had good questions. One person in the audience asked a tough question about how I make the decision to cut out code thatʼs no longer useful versus re-implementing it from scratch. So, at what point do you determine itʼs best to just re-engineer the entire module. I didnʼhave a good answer and definitely fumbled around with no real content. :-(</p>
	    <p>Other than that, I got a total of like 6 questions which was a lot more than other speakers and felt my responses were strong and meaningful. It was really cool that my talk generated a lot of interest.</p>
	    <p>One person asked if it was easy to get the old users to move over to use the new system. I started by saying, "Yes. Iʼm veryhandsome and good with selling things so it was easy" I paused and said, "Iʼm justjoking" and that got laughs. I also told them that Iget into a lot of arguments with my wife and I feel theyʼre notdriven by logic on her end but, rather, by emotion. I related that to getting users to move off of an old system how their attachment is really just emotional and not a functional one. It was a nice way to answer the question with a personal touch. Also, Iʼm prettysure I offended all of the married women in the audience. Hahaha.</p>
	    <p>During my presentation, I remember one guy in particular yawning A LOT. And he did it with the upmost confidence, making direct eye contact with me while yawning. Hahaha. I learned to not mind these things especially with a varied audience. And it was in the early evening anyway, Iʼm sure many people were sleepy at that point.</p>
