<p>I made an excursion this afternoon to the Freehold hospital with
my son. I have pictures, but unfortunately, the important thing
(the actual room and stage area) isn't here:</p>
<p>On the plus side, I have many cute pictures of my son including
a video of him jumping around.</p>
<div class="col-lg-12">
<p>The conference room was being used so I felt weird walking in
and taking pictures. I can describe it. It's not an auditorium type
setting, so the stage is at the same level as the audience. The
room is very wide and I saw what looked like two stage areas next
to each other, each with its own podium and microphone.</p>
<p>I don't know what the set up will be like for the contest, but
there's ample space for a decent sized audience and they even had
tables set up (so you can find the judges easily ... haha).</p>
<p>The actual venue is very nice, despite the fact that it's a
hospital. This building doesn't seem very hospital-ish at all and
it's physically separate from the main hospital anyway. There's a
nice looking outdoor area right outside the conference room.
Bathrooms are easily accessible and nearby. It's definitely the
better venue among the three contest settings I've been to (the
church, the Rahway library, and your second contest where I brought
my wife and son).</p>
<p>Finding the medical center was easy but I got lost inside the
campus. You have to check the signs and look for "Star and Barry
Tobias Ambulatory Campus" (just like in Aida's email). Eventually
though, the signs stopped showing this and I followed "North
Parking Lot". From there, I parked in the employee parking lot
(Since I'm a doctor) and went into Medical Building A. I went here
just by luck but it turned out to be the entrance closest to the
Jack Aaronson Conference Center. Turns out your assumption is
correct: the auditorium is a room inside the conference center but
is not at all your traditional auditorium. Just a regular room.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this helps. Sorry I couldn't get pictures of the
actual speaking area but hope I described it ok. Feel free to share
this email with whomever might be interested, including the Dropbox
link since my son is so handome.</p>
