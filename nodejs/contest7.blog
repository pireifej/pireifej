<p class="excert">I'll start this long rant by saying that I did
very well and I'm proud of myself and the progress I made. It was
the best version of that speech. I even had a callback that worked
out very well. I got good laughs at all the expected places (except
the pants joke which is mediocre anyway).</p>
<p>The first speaker (who ended up winning the contest) talked
about her difficulty with communication because she comes from
Japan. She had a joke about her difficulty to say election because
it sounds like erection. I substituted my "attention" joke with
something you'll hear in the video: "You have to pay attention to
your son. Unless he's trying to say election and it sounds like
erection. Then just ignore it." Something like that. It got a lot
of laughs.</p>

<p>I disagree completely with the woman who won 2nd place. Her
speech was disgusting. It was a speech about getting old. She used
that same thing you did in your speech about being old. I don't
remember the words but it was like a poem that rhymed. It had
something about farting in it. She talked about her body parts
including her breasts. It was crude and disgusting. There's even
something in the rules about how the speech shouldn't contain crude
language.</p>
<p>The contestants who won third and first place deserved it. The
Japanese woman was very funny. The third place talked about his
GPS. His jokes were clever and well executed.</p>
<p>This will sound like sour grapes but I thought I did the best
(oh really, Paul?). I even had a call back! Another woman had a
callback to the same speech but didn't go over as well. When they
announced the third and second place winners I thought I got it.
But I was SO surprised about that second place winner. She really
shouldn't have placed.</p>
<p>Now to spread rumors. I heard (people are saying) that the
judges were all women so the women competition had an edge by
default. And, thinking about it, all speakers except 3 were women
but one guy placed so I'm not totally convinced about that theory
though it might explain that 2nd place winner.</p>
<p>The other thing is I heard something about speaker order that
goes against my original theory (or at least is an amendment to my
theory). People are saying that the first and last speakers have
the edge. I was super happy when I got 4 for my speaking order. But
the middle may not be the best after all. The idea is that judges
use the first speech as the standard (since it's the best speech at
that point since it's the only one they heard so far) and judge
subsequent speeches against that. And the last speech is also
preferred since it's fresh in their mind. It's like how when you
read an email you usually read the beginning, the end and skim the
rest of it. Like what you're probably doing with my email.</p>
<p>--3-- (excuse my French) pisses me off. He came up to me
afterwards and said "we need to talk later." I knew exactly what he
wanted to talk about and almost threw my diaper bag in his face. He
made reference to the "political" joke. I responded to him very
impatiently but told him I don't agree and the joke got good
response. He then said that he's proud of me because I came a long
way (keep in mind he was with me from the beginning. He knows the
awful place I started from with TM). I appreciate the kind words he
used eventually but that should've been the only thing he told
me.</p>
<p>One person was disqualified for going over time. People thought
it was me and that's why I didn't place. But I was sitting right
next to the timers and saw the woman who went over. She went 7 min
31 seconds. I was shocked. It's such a shame. Granted, her speech
wasn't that good anyway.</p>
<p>I would say there were like 3 speeches that simply weren't good.
Got very few laughs and not polished. My interview was hilarious
and sincere and wonderful: <iframe width="560" height="315" src=

<p>Watch closely in the interview. At one point, the camera man
comes up to me to take a picture. I stop talking, look at him and
smile. The timing was perfect. It got good laughs.</p>
<p>So, thanks for reading. I'll complain about it next time we meet
in person. Thanks for your pep talk and your continued support.
Even if I'm not area director, I'm retiring from contests. It's
probably the cocaine talking but I really don't feel I have
anything more to prove. I feel that any future attempts would be me
just trying the same thing but hoping I have good luck. --4-- was
amazing. He should've won first place. He was hilarious. His speech
had pure emotion. It made us laugh, cry and everything in
between.</p>
<p>Sorry for my vicious rant.</p>
<p>I realized I sent my rant to you from my gmail account. I copied
over the thread into this email so I can use icloud (just more
convenient for me). First of all, I have your CISSP book ready to
return to you. It's still in good condition! I took good care of
it. I'll give it back as soon as you return to the office. I hope
the appointment today is going (or went) well.</p>
<p>Just a few other tidbits I thought of. Not ranting, just quirky
details for amusement. I always struggle with finding a place to
sit for a contest and this past Saturday was no exception. I ended
up sitting next to ${5} for the first half the contest (the table
topics portion). This turned out to be a mistake (shouldn't have
been a surprise but my judgement isn't great when I'm stressed out
- haha). He made side comments to me after each table topic
contestant was done and his clapping literally broke my left ear.
Yes, his clapping is that loud!</p>
<p>Speaking of evaluating, I went through the list of candidates on
the district 83 website and have comments about their speech. I
find it kind of soothing and it's a good retrospective:</p>
<p>--1-- (2nd place winner) - Her speech was about getting old.
Even though her speech was crude and disgusting, she got a lot of
laughs. The material was very female-centric for sure and probably
only relate-able to the women in the audience. She used that Dr.
Seuss poem I mentioned meaning a good bulk of her content wasn't
even her own.</p>
<p>--2-- - This was the guy who won first place at the first
district humorous contest I attended years ago. Unfortunately, I
didn't watch his speech because I had to step out to call my wife
and check up on them. From time to time, I stood close to the doors
of the room during his speech and I heard a decent amount of
laughter. I tried to peek in between the doors and saw him holding
a blue folder so I'm guessing he used props.</p>
<p>The following four contestants I don't remember and
(coincidentally) there were three contestants who's speeches
weren't memorable though I think they got good laughs. One woman
spoke about her heritage, another spoke about "aliens" which meant
her teenagers and how they speak a language that's practically
foreign, another told a story about a road trip she had with
someone who was diabetic and always used the phrased "... but
that's beside the point" which was clever but I felt over used. The
"alien" woman went over time (7 min 31 sec). A fourth woman (I
think Majorie) gave a speech that was definitely more motivational
opposed to humorous but definitely fell short on both counts. It
was about her playing baseball as a child (I think?). I tuned it
out after like 1 minute of listening.</p>
<ul>
<li>--6--</li>
<li>--7--</li>
<li>--8--</li>
<li>--9--</li>
</ul>
<p>--10-- (3rd place winner) - Spoke about his "girlfriend" which
was later revealed to be his GPS. This was a GOOD speech. He
deserved second place; must cleaner material than Dori). He had
very clever jokes, speech was memorable, he spoke about an instance
where his Google Maps GPS was arguing with his Garmin. Very
funny!</p>
<p>--11-- (1rst place winner) - Definitely deserved a place in the
top 3. She spoke about her difficulty with pronouncing English
words (given she was born in Japan). She had very good gestures,
vocal variety, got good laughs. I felt she had too much "down time"
like too much background information about herself; basically, time
with no laughs. It was a decent amount of non-entertaining set up
material that allowed me to drift off (maybe I just have a short
attention span). My guess is that her speech had more weight (if
you follow the judging criteria strictly) because her message had
an inspirational undertone. It was how she was taught that "silence
is gold" but she learned that the gold is worth nothing. So, it was
a powerful and original message -- good optimistic take away.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the order should've been: Me 1rst (obviously),
--11-- 2nd and --10-- 3rd. We had the best speeches. --1-- getting
up there HAD to be due to politics (either intentionally or
unintentionally) or some kind of fluke. 3 days later I still think
it's ridiculous. Hahaha.</p>
<p>The lessons that I can probably learn from this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Luck is involved in all stages in the competition and it
influences the outcome. Basically, the contests are rigged
(joking!). From speaking order to judge selection (especially from
the perspective of whether or not the judges are really following
the judging criteria), many, many, many factors are variable,
non-trivial and out of our control independent of our
speeches.</li>
<li>The message is important. It's good to have a theme/motto and
refer back to the motto throughout the speech in creative ways. You
might think of the humorous speech as being inspirational that has
jokes interleaved smoothly.</li>
<li>No matter what level of the competition, a significant number
of contestants won't be good. So, even if there are 10 contestants
you still have a good chance of winner with a polished and well
intentioned speech. Also, stuff happens like speakers will drop out
and the 2nd place speakers will have to step up. It doesn't mean
their speeches are bad but they're typically not as prepared &
rehearsed as they should be.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other thing that came to mind is that your speech and
--4--'s speeches are very competitive. I still feel bad that you
didn't get through but think your material and presentation is good
enough for the district level.</p>
<p>The other interesting tidbit: the drive to the contest was kind
of an adventure. I left our house 5 min to 1 and --4-- was driving
into the driveway while I was stepping out. I love his punctuality.
We didn't have to wait too long at all for --5--; maybe 3 minutes.
So my concern was moot.</p>
<p>First off, --5-- had his long rants about stuff .. I just laid
back and tried to phase it out. I'm actually to blame for the
"adventure" part and thank God we had 30 min buffer time! We ran
into traffic because a lane was closed (thanks, Christie!). It took
a long time to get out of it so I had to admit to --4-- and --5--
that I REALLY had to pee. I told them that I have anxiety before a
contest and will have an emergency very, very soon. I think the
words I used were, "We might have to clean this seat if we don't
find a restroom soon." --4-- was kind enough to take an exit and
find a gas station. During this time, --5-- just HAD to tell us a
"joke". He told you that our sense of humor is "corny." Well his
sense of humor sucks -- plain & simple. It was this LONG joke about
elephants. "How many elephants blah blah and then how many
elephants blah blah ..". I felt like it went on for 30 min. --4--
and I told him the joke is stupid. I told him not even my kids
would enjoy that joke. That made my "holding it" much more
painful.</p>
<p>I ran inside, did my business and got out. --4-- was super angry
because he also tried to use the restroom but the person working
there was mean to him and didn't let him in (I think I must've ran
in behind the guy's back or something! I wasn't stopped at all). I
felt bad because --4-- was furious (like cursing) so I felt it
might impact his performance at the contest. After that, we missed
some turns getting back to the highway which was unfortunate but
still managed to get to the hotel with ample time.</p>
<p>After that, things seemed to settle down. I emailed --4-- and
--5-- when I got back home that night to apologize (again) for the
incident but was honest with --4--: I told him he did the best he
possibly could with the question. Everything I said in my
presidential email to the group Saturday night is 100% true. He
deserved to win but had to settle with 2nd place which is still a
very significant accomplishment for table topics.</p>
<p>Finally, in conclusion, I wanted to say that the microphone was
indeed transparent. What I didn't know is that audio professionals
set up the contestants ahead of time. Just one time I accidentally
hit it with my hand when I added "... of Toastmasters" following my
very offensive "Trump" joke. People were laughing at that point
anyway so I doubt people heard it. But other than that, it worked
flawlessly and had 0 impact on my performance.</p>
<p>Thanks! Sorry again for the long email. When we meet again, we
won't have anything else to talk about. Haha. Good luck with your
appointments today.</p>
