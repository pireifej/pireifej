      I’m typing this up on the plane from San Francisco back to good old New Jersey. I had a really good experience. The hotel (more like a resort) was beautiful. It’s in the middle of nowhere but surrounded by mountains. I even took an opportunity to go hiking in what seemed like a desert; lots of cactuses (cactii?) and other AZ-specific things. It was also rather hot so I turned around early into my hike. Haha.

	    I came in on Monday and checked the room where I would be speaking but the door was locked. I slept well that night (no weird noises, no waking up and wandering around at 3 AM). I got up really early for AZ time (around 5 AM, since obviously I was still in NJ time so that’s like 8 AM here). I got to the conference room to scope it out again and it was wide open with a registration desk (no people) just outside. The room was cold, but there were lots of chairs and drinks (soda, coffee, you name it - yummy!). They had two screens (like you probably saw in the picture I sent) and a podium in the center. It was a nice room, the stage is very long. There were lots
of chairs, the audience turned out to be (as far as I could remember) bigger than what was in Chicago.

	  <p>
	    Here is a picture from the back. And this is what I saw from the podium (of course, with human beings lol).

	    They had an introduction session that morning. I was forced to introduce myself, which was a good ice breaker to my speaking publicly after a long flight. This intro session was apparently
	    something that many people skip out on because the room was sparse. I gave a short intro and we were supposed to say something we had hoped to get out of the conference. I told them I spoke already at the Chicago session last year and appreciate the networking and speaking opportunities.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I skipped out on some talks to go back to the room to change into the suit/tie attire and practice. I was really quite nervous. The people seem, uh, smart and like, more confident with fraud mitigation than myself. I felt a little bit bad that my talk wasn’t fraud-centric like others. That hurt my confidence a little. I took a short snooze (can’t really sleep-sleep before a talk, haha, the nerves won’t let me). But during this brief moment of unconsciousness, I came up with a few more opportunities to inject fraud-specific information into my talk. So it turned out to be good.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When I walked to the room for the actual real deal talk, very nervous indeed, I went up the staircase and crossed over the outdoor bridge / walkway. The view is really profound. I had a little moment just be grateful that I was even there with these professionals in this beautiful environment (eating really good, free food).

	      But you can see it looks like something from a magazine. Yes, my google phone takes awesome pictures but it was quite the view. The conference room was at this level, only a few feet away. It felt magnificent. We don’t get this kind of stuff in Jersey lol.
	    </p>

	      When I went in, a gentleman Seth talked to me. I actually had chatted with him on the phone (I think I told you). He’s from a start up company that he started that deals with tracking down used phones and giving the customer an inventive (buy-back) for returning them. It uses the IMEI to do this, so he’s looking for large carriers to help by providing an API to basically return a true/false for if the IME is blacklisted or locked. Anyway, he has a very Steve Jobs-like vibe.

	      He talked to me briefly but recognized that I was about to speak and let me off the hook saying something like, “I’ll let you get into the game”. I appreciate that some people have the sensibility to leave you alone when you’re about to present. It doesn’t come naturally to most people!
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I made my rounds to and from the bathroom (which was downstairs again, so kind of a long walk). The long walk helped to just walk out the anxiety I was feeling. I went down a long corridor that had pictures and explained a little about the history of the hotel. It was educational and a good distraction.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I finally forced myself to walk back to the room. This was all during a break, so I went when the break was supposed to end. They did a rapid fire (which I guess means just a quick 10 minute presentation, I was disappointed because I thought they were going to shoot someone which would have been very entertaining). The presenter was also named Paul! Nice name. He was foreign and spoke with a heavy accent, saying “Yes?” After each sentence. At this time, maybe because of the nerves / escalated sense of urgency or the coffee I had just beforehand, my brain was on rapid fire and I came up with new material & jokes really quickly. I jotted everything down. I had heard most of the conference at this point and AT&T was brought up many times but in the form of a question, like people asking to get more insight into what AT&T is doing to tackle certain problems. And jokes just kept pouring into my head. I ended up adding the following content to my intro:
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I heard AT&amp;T come up during this conference but usually in the form of a question, such as how does AT&amp;T handle this? How does AT&amp;T handle that? I hope to shed some insight on this today. I
	      won’t have all the answers for you, and no, I can’t help you fix your phone. I learned that one way to get your abstract accepted is by making the title long and confusing so that’s what I did here (before explaining what my title meant). (When I introduced the idea of documentation) I heard and appreciate the vision that many of you have to do knowledge sharing and have the larger carriers expose APIs. Well, it all starts with doing documentation because how do you know what services you can offer if you don’t document first?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I confirmed with Roberta (the host/organizer of the presentations) that she had my slides and a remote clicking device. She’s very responsive and organized so she had everything ready for me. They hooked me up with a speaking device and off I was! I set up my paper notes and my phone (to time myself) on the podium in the center. I felt rushed but made sure to not rush myself even though I was now the center of attention, all eyes on me, but I took my time because I wanted to time myself. I did my stuff, looked up, and began!
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Like I said before (so no surprise), it went really well. Extraordinarily well. All thanks to you. Haha. Seriously. The slides looked really nice on the two big screens, the text was enlarged because of what you told me, the pictures were much more neatly arranged and I spoke fluently!!! Yay!!! I think I came off as confident & comfortable. At the mid-point of my slides, I checked the time and it just climbed to the 15 minute mark which is perfect. I had a joke: “This is the mid point of my presentation. If you fell asleep, that’s fine, but you can wake up now because this is the most important part of the presentation.” This was when I introduced the very cleverly named slide knowledge transfer category ratios (sound familiar? Haha). So it’s important because I highlight the four areas I think should take a priority and how much time you should spend on each task.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      After that, it was smooth sailing. I had more jokes; all jokes were received well. I ended just before 30 mins and opened it up to questions. The first gentleman who asked a question is someone who seems like comes to every conference. He talks a lot and I remember him from the Chicago conference. He was the first to ask a question even after that talk and it was a hardball question that I struggled with. This time, he didn’t ask anything. He just told me what a good job I did and highlighted something specific he wanted felt was noteworthy (I think it had to do with documentation). I responded with “I like the questions that aren’t really questions,
but are just comments on what a good job I did.” That got the most laughs out of anything that day and even got applause! It was a nice moment. The rest of the questions were fine, I answered them easily as they were mostly just opinion based questions. There were many people that raised their hands and the moderator had to cut them short. I really appreciate that there were was so much interest in my talk.
	    </p>
	    <p> I realized the paper notes really didn’t’ cut it. After each slide, before moving on to the next slide, I took some time to look at my notes to make sure I didn’t miss anything. But it was slow, a little more downtime during the talk than I felt comfortable with. So I’m not sure what would have been better to do the next time. I can’t use the noes embedded into the slide because I don’t look at my laptop during the talk. It’s in front of Roberta and I don’t see it. I also found myself turning my head to look at the slides more often that I had wanted to.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      After the talk, someone else went up and they actually made reference to my speech. He noted that before many companies were outsourcing work to places like India but they started bringing them back in-house like Paul explained (haha).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We had another break and I stepped outside. Someone walked up to me and said they really enjoyed my talk. They said it was the most concise and clear/articulate talk they heard all day. I was really
	      flattered. Another lady told me she was texting with Adam Something (last name is masked for confidentiality .. and because I don’t know his last name lol). He works for AT&amp;T in fraud, he must be someone higher up. She said she was texting him things like, “This guy is really good .. and he’s funny!”. I got a kick out of that.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      It was really nice going to the conference the next day. I got some more verbal accolades from people and obviously felt more comfortable / much less tense. Haha. I felt different when traversing the same route (hotel room to stairs to walkway with the beautiful view). I probably mentioned this before, but I really enjoy revisiting places where I was tense before. It’s nice to remind myself of the challenge I experienced at that place and then it feels smaller / less intimidating than it did before. Yay.
	    </p>
	    <div class="col-lg-12 mt-25"></div>
	    <p> Thanks as always for your support. Like I mentioned in my email to the Toastmasters group, your feedback and time with me in particular was very valuable. Your feedback really did make all the difference. I felt much more confident after revising the slides. You gave me a better way to explain “mech ID” that I wouldn’t have thought of before! Yay to Thomas! It’s early cool that we both did something that scares us a day apart. I could tell you were nervous before your web security tech talk and glad it went went. Sure you didn’t get the audience you were hoping for, but there was a storm (out of your control) and you’re still just starting out! I delved into an already well established organization and you’re starting completely from scratch building out your own thing. It’s very admirable.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      That night, after the talk, I went to a Toastmasters group. They were a very friendly group, had a few good speakers, but I was disappointed they didn’t give me a table topics question and really an opportunity to speak at great length. I wanted to tell them how I just did a professional talk and Toastmasters helped me to practice. But oh well.

		At the end of that long day, I realized I was awake for over 17 hours. I wanted to pull a Jack Bauer and wait until it became a solid 24 but thought it would be wise to sleep at that point.
