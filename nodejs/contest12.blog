<p class="excert">The subject of this email, of course, refers to
the gossip/rumor from --49-- that he attempted to spread that
turned out to be, uh, nothing. :-) I'm very clever. Not sure if you
heard but I placed first in the Division Tall Tales Contest. I had
a good feeling really early on. Actually, I had planned to ask
someone in the audience to record my speech because, being that
it's division, I acknowledge it might be the last time I perform
the speech in front of an audience. But, literally moments before I
had the opportunity to ask someone, I decided not to just because I
felt really confident (it was a magical feeling, really). I also
felt like having someone record me would act as a safety net;
almost as if I was giving myself permission to fail. We don't want
that!!!</p>
<p>The contest started out normal enough with --50-- taking the
helm. She seemed fairly organized and dealt with the hurdles of
people not showing up last minute pretty well. Her introduction was
a little sloppy (she forgot that she had to call up the Chief
Judge) but, eh, whatever. She was totally charismatic and committed
to her role. I considered it to be a minor overlook. It was much
better than the train wreck that is --16-- (is that his name?).</p>

<p>I got to the parking lot of the Bayshore Community Hospital
roughly 1.5 hours early (which is a little conservative.. wanted to
give myself a buffer in case it takes me a long time to walk from
the car to the hospital door - LOL). It was cold out so I sat
inside, contemplating all of the decisions I made in my life that
led up to this point (typical Paul Ireifej fashion). I went over my
speech, just the verbal part, in my car while watching the timer. I
made my rounds to-and-from the hospital to use the bathroom but
pretty much stayed in the car for about an hour.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided it was about the time where if someone did
see me inside, they wouldn't think I'm crazy. So I head inside
directly to the (you guessed it) bathroom. Oh, sweet solace of the
bathroom. There were actually people there (the contest room, not
the bathroom). So I wasn't that crazy. They were setting up the
food and things. --27-- was there, I gave her a hug, and did the
usual pleasantries.</p>
<p>My competitor, whom I built up a great fear towards at this
point, --51-- was there. He was dressed up in workout clothes so I
thought he wasn't taking this contest very seriously. I gave up on
the suit-and-tie attire during these lower level contests but at
least I still attempt to dress professionally. Little did I know
(foreshadowing!) he was dressed this way for his speech (lead the
audience on to continue reading!) ...</p>
<p>I made my usual rounds of nervously pacing back & forth around
the hallways of the hospital. And then, --52-- came!!! Our --52--
from our club (my mentee). It was nice to see him and I relaxed a
bit. He sat next to me, and I apologized to him ahead of time
because I admitted he would see a different side of me which is the
nervous/sweaty/anxious/pacing pre-contest Paul Ireifej. --52--,
with his typical indifferent / easygoing personality, grumbled
things like "eh, well, whatever, it's OK." Hahahaha. He had his
giant binder, which I'm now convinced he carries around with him
everywhere he goes.</p>
<p>My dear friend, --53-- (previous Area 23 Director and previous
Division, I want to say, D Director?) joined us as well! I was
pleasantly surprised to see her. She said she had a lot of vacation
hours to burn up before the end of the year but I knew she really
just came for the free food. LOL. I was hoping contest officials
would jump at her to recruit her to be a judge. Being that she's
not in our area, she's a very attractive candidate to be recruited
as a judge (and she would be totally biased towards me). But, alas,
they only recruited her as a ballot counter because our friend
--54--, didn't make it. I texted him about it later and he said he
couldn't come because of "wife issues." I thought he meant health
issues but he assured me she was OK. Not to pull a --49-- and
spread rumors, but I'm guessing there's trouble in paradise. Yeah,
probably. Also, Henry Ford is a racist.</p>
<p>When we did the contestant briefings, it was noted that --55--
(the other contestant) wasn't there. --50-- hinted that she was
still waiting for --55-- to show up but both --27-- and myself
reminded --50-- that, as per the contest rule book, once the
contestant briefings finished, the window for contestants is
closed. We later heard from --55-- (via text message to a friend)
that he had a work emergency and couldn't make it. When we drew the
numbers for speaking order, I picked my piece of paper last and got
#1. I felt bad because I don't prefer going up first as you know.
--27-- got #2 and --51-- got #3. I felt --51-- would have the edge
but, in a contest of just 3, I don't know that it matters that
much.</p>
<p>At this point, they're doing the contest introduction (--50--
Contest Chair and --45--, brandished with what appeared to be a
lovely finger/hand cast, as Chief Judge). They were fine, got to
the meat & potatoes fairly quickly. --50--, God Bless her soul,
pronounced my last name 100% correctly. I'm really tense now
because I'm expecting an amazing speech from --51-- (who stole my
first name and used it as his last name). Interesting side factoid:
I try not to judge a contestant just from casual conversation
before the contest because I know that it's a tense time for
everyone. The side formalities does not reflect how they will
perform when it's show time. But, I will say that, just from
talking to him briefly I kind of knew he wouldn't be terribly
intimidating as a speaker. He seemed like generally a reluctant
person and he had a slight accent. I'm not being racist (like Henry
Ford) but I know that an accent equates to slight complexity on the
side of the listener to interpret words. Which is normally fine but
in a contest, I would think the judges prefer the path of least
resistance when it comes to audio processing.</p>
<p>There I am, in my chair, pen in hand and notebook -- oh, wait,
sorry. I'm sitting there, feeling very tense and confident at the
same time. And then, I am called up!</p>
<h1>1. Paul Ireifej - "Improvise and Don't Apologize" (placed
first)</h1>
<p>--50-- read my speech title as "Improvise. Don't Apologize."
which is, eh, OK I guess. Maybe she was exercising her artistic
license which she actually isn't entitled to as a contest chair
LOL. I purposefully started using the word "and" instead of the
ampersand "&amp;" just to avoid confusion. But, yeah, apparently
didn't help. At this point, I've been practicing my speech like a
crazy person all day. I also did it during one of my nervous paces
before the contest in the little huddle space I described in my
first email about the Area contest. So I was truly on auto-pilot,
spitting out words in almost the exact order as I did countless
times before almost on an automatic timer (since I watch the clock
closely during my practice runs) - haha.</p>
<p>I performed well. My mouth felt dry (despite the fact that I
took many sips of water beforehand) and so I felt the speech wasn't
as fluent as it usually is but it's a very minor point that wasn't
at all noticeable. One artifact of the dry mouth was that my
"Rrrrrrr" sound after describing my plastic surgery wasn't that
audible. But it got giggles anyway.</p>
<p>During my practice runs, I was playing around with different
body movements during my evaluation to appear as "charismatic" as
per Dr. Ralph Smedly's advice. One thing I did which I personally
enjoyed is jumping from one side of the stage to the other when
describing the speaker making "words come out of his mouth." I did
this during my contest speech and, boy, it went over really well.
The audience was very entertained by the body language.</p>
<p>One global comment I have about my speech is that it felt *too*
polished. Again, an artifact of practicing incessantly. It's hard
to find the right balance between sounding polished and sounding
genuine. Eh, whatever. A second global comment I have is that I
went too fast. I can actually understand how Randolph got a time of
4:45, I think I was just blaming his timing skills, but now that I
think about it, it might reflect reality. I think I legitimately
speed up (significantly) when I'm up there. I saw --56-- (the timer
man) raise the yellow flag and I felt I really started to ramp up
at that point. I never saw the red flag, even when I finished my
speech, so I suspect I was good on time and panicked
unnecessarily.</p>
<p>I added something at the end, which was the result of collective
feedback from the club and from you. I mentioned that "the old man"
was applauding with the rest of the audience and smiled at me
"approvingly." I said this part nice & slow. I think it was very
effective. Nice touch!</p>
<p>Something I felt myself do is ... breath. When I felt a trouble
word coming up, I felt myself exercise the "breathing" technique
and just blended my breath into the trouble word. This is something
they taught me to do in speech therapy and it's really cool to feel
myself doing it now. I think, if anything, the pauses acted as
effective breaks in the flow of the story.</p>
<p>Here is my "laugh summary characterization table" (or LSCT for
short):</p>
<ol>
<li>President joke -- Laugh +++</li>
<li>"Words came out of his mouth" -- Laugh+++</li>
<li>E-alliteration sentence -- Laugh+</li>
<li>U/P- alliteration sentences -- Laugh</li>
<li>Plastic surgery -- few giggles</li>
<li>"Probably because I wasn't paying attention" -- few
giggles</li>
</ol>
<p>Something that I was genuinely amazed by (and didn't expect) was
the suspense I was able to orchestrate at the end of my speech. It
is so empowering to have the ability to grab & hold on to
everyone's attention for a brief moment. I did the ending with such
incredible slow pacing & suspense that you could feel the tension
in the room. I saw everyone looking at me, not blinking, bated
breath, as I revealed the identity of the old man. It was really
cool.</p>
<p>I got amazing feedback from people individually. One gentleman
told me that my evaluation sounds like ALL of the evaluations he's
ever done at his club. Which, actually speaks to my larger (more
cynical) point of the speech (I have two points):</p>
<ol>
<li>evaluations in Toastmasters are cheesy. I feel like what is
typically considered a "good" evaluation can lack in substance but
make up for it in the performance / presentation. This then leads
to my larger point</li>
<li>which is that Toastmasters speeches in general tend to be a tad
superficial and puts too much emphasis on the theatrics. Of course,
I don't advertise this opinion because I like to win trophies. I'm
incredibly insecure and need trophies to reaffirm my
manhood...</li>
</ol>
<p>One gentleman, I wish I knew his name, and a woman next to him
(possibly his wife? mistress? I love to spread rumors now). They
both gave me VERY flattering feedback. I was almost embarrassed.
The gentleman acknowledged that the ending was very suspenseful and
that I had his attention. He also told me he saw a live show
recently with Alec Baldwin (the Trump impersonator) and some other
guy (didn't recognize the name) and said my performance reminded
him of that show! He asked if I was a thespian. I almost punched
him in the face, but after <a href=
"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/thespian">googling the term</a>,
was flattered. He further commented on my ability to transform in
between characters seamlessly. The nice lady next to him was
interested in trying our improv group (I talked about it during my
interview) and she emailed me after the contest asking to be added
to the distribution list. I need to consult with the Improv 2
Improve Master --57-- and ask for permission first since she's a
community member and I'm not sure how that will work. I'll wait to
hear back from him. :-)</p>
<p>Another thing: The Contest Chair, --50--, admitted to us during
the contestant briefings that she has tremors. So, her hand shakes
uncontrollably. Well, with my Ralph Smedly impersonation, I make my
hand shake (if you recall). I felt bad for doing that. I kind of
regret incorporating that into the act. That was how I practiced it
and that's one way I help myself to transform into Ralph Smedly so
I didn't feel comfortable taking it out at the last minute, I feel
it would've thrown off my performance.</p>
<h1>2. --27-- - "My Adventure in Colorado" (placed second)</h1>
<p>Her speech didn't change that much. I think, if anything, she
had more props at the table to her side. She had Toastmasters gift
certificates, the Toastmasters magazine where her article was
published and some other things that weren't used. I think that
it's very impressive that she got an article in the TI magazine. I
feel like she wanted to speak about it, and build a Tall Tales
around it, but she approached the story from a boring angle. I
would've made up a story about how she got her article to be
recognized by TI but instead she cobbled together two stories that
are real (1 being her published article and 2 being the fact that
she fell into a wall and ended up in a class for expectant mothers
just before doing a speech -- like, that really happened). She
tried to loosely tie those two stories together with ideas she has
to improve Toastmasters. So it really felt like an informational
speech / proposal that she would like to put forward. And her
ending is weak, something like, "Truth or fiction? You decide."</p>
<p>But, in all honestly and sincerity, she placed second in a
Division contest. Taking that by itself at face value, is an
accomplishment for someone like --27--. I make fun of her a lot
(um, like a lot, as in every 20 minutes or so) but I've really seen
her grow as a speaker and she is deserving of accolades. I heard
her do a roast of --58-- earlier this year at some recognition
event (Hare and Farewell?) and it was really funny. She was one of
the best & most entertaining speakers there. So, yeah, cheers to
you --27--.</p>
<h1>3. --51-- - "Exercise" (placed third)</h1>
<p>Another reason I felt that --51-- wouldn't live up to the hype
is his speech title. I thought, "Exercise", well, it's boring and
forgettable. But, on the other hand, there's a lot of opportunity
for humor when talking about a subject like exercise. When he
started to speak, I knew it wasn't going to be that competitive of
a speech. His speech quickly became boring and redundant. I took
notes and for some reason outlined his speech so here it is in a
nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>The secret to lose weight / stay healthy is to clap a lot (this
is actually a one line substitution that encompasses his entire
speech LOL)</li>
<li>NASA did rereplace on this</li>
<li>5 minutes of clapping creates "Artificial Intelligence" around
your body and causes your internal organs to vibrate violently (I
understand it's tall tales, but seriously it should at least be a
LITTLE bit plausible and shouldn't use random tech terms that you
heard about on a podcast that you have no idea what it means
LOL)</li>
<li>Three reasons to clap more: no cost, no pain / side effects,
can do it anywhere/everywhere</li>
<li>This part he had what I consider to be inappropriate jokes /
literally toilet humor. He said: you can do it while "taking a
dump" (literal words), during a meeting / conference call and then
for (kidding you not) "self pleasure" (to put it eloquently). He
made a joke that you can do it while in bed with your partner. And
if she's not interested you can do it alone (and proceeded, kid you
not, to "clap" around his genital area). Yes, you read this
correctly. I am not joking. Sightly lacking tact if you will.</li>
<li>He then tried to make politic jokes which largely fell flat
because his pronunciation of people's names just wasn't clear. He
made reference to the 2020 election, how health care isn't needed
anymore, something about Elizabeth Warren and Warren Buffett (hey
we're on a role for people who's last names are other people's
first names LOLOL).</li>
<li>TI has made a patent for clapping.</li>
<li>I don't remember the ending. Oh, yeah, he got everyone to clap
which is, um, what people normally do at the end of a speech
anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>One reason for his downfall was that it wasn't a tall tale.
--27--'s speech was more of a legitimate tall tale and that's
probably why she placed 2nd and this guy placed 3rd. It felt like
the elixir speech in that it was just a false sales pitch. During
his interview, he mentioned that he doesn't really exercise much
and the he had only purchased the workout clothes for his speech.
Hahahahaha. :-)</p>
<p>Well, look at that, I'm all done! Thanks again for reading. Now
I need a nap. I hope your event with Wynter went well and thanks so
much for responding to my texts last night. I hope your wife didn't
mind too much :-)</p>
<p>Onward to District!!!!!!!!!!!! Time to put this speech on the
shelf for 6 months LOL. I don't have to do the Rrrrrrr sound in a
while, or pretend to be a zombie version of Ralph Smedly. ^_^</p>
