Lord, my Rock and Redeemer, thank you that you are great and abundant in power, your strength is beyond measure. The Bible says that you are able to bless me abundantly, so that in all things at all times, you will supply everything I need, and I will abound in every good work. Give me strength I need today Lord, may I thrive in the power of your spirit. May your love be the passion in my heart. May your joy be my strength when times are hard. May your presence be my peace that overflows. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen.
