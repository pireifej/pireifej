Heavenly Father, we come before you to thank you for all you have done and continue to do in our lives and marriage. Lord, we come before you on this day, Father, asking for a stronger bond of unity in our marriage covenant.

Lord, we pray that you will give us the power to be a united front for you. Letting nothing come between us.

Assist us, God, to identify and work through everything that is not pleasing to you. So we can continually attain higher levels of unity in our marriage spiritually, physically, and mentally.

Father, we are thankful and happy to see the work of your hands. As we try our best to find your grace daily. We love you and thank you for all of these things.
