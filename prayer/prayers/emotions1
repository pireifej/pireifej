Loving Father, I come before you with faith in your promise that whatever
I ask for in your name you will grant to me if it is for the good of my soul
and in accordance with your Divine Will.

I come trusting in your great love for me and believing
that only you know what is best for me.
I come to you now to ask that you enter my heart
and heal all my wounded emotions.

You know me better than I know myself.
Bring your healing love into every corner of my heart and release
all the buried negative emotions inside that have not been resolved
and continue to cause me pain and anguish.

Remove all my unhealed hurts and painful memories that
block the flow of your graces, robbing me of your peace, love and joy.
Heal all feeling of sadness, loneliness, fear and anxiety.
Heal all guilt, despair, feelings of betrayal and rejection.
Heal all feelings of anger, hatred, resentment and bitterness.

Bring your healing love to all my emotions that have caused me feelings
of hopelessness, discouragement, helplessness and despair.
Grant me the grace to forgive all those who caused these negative emotions
and likewise to be forgiven by those to whom I have done the same harm.

And then, dear Father, after I have been healed may I be a witness of your
healing power and bring glory, honor and praise to you.

This I pray in Jesus' name through Mary and all the saints.
