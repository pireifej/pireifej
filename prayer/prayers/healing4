All our times are in Thy hand.
All diseases come at Thy call, and go at Thy bidding.
Thou redeemest our life from destruction, and crownest us with loving kindness and tender mercies. We bless Thee, that Thou hast heard prayer, and commanded deliverances for our friend and Thy servant, who has been under Thine afflicting hand.
He (or she) was brought low, but Thou hast helped him (her). May he (she) not only live, but declare the works of the Lord!
As Thou hast delivered his eyes from tears, his feet from falling, and his soul from death, may he daily inquire:What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me,and resolve to offer unto Thee the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and to call upon the name of the Lord.
May we ever remember that recovery is only a reprieve and that some day we will go to our rest in the Lord. May we therefore secure the righteous path and live with eternity ever in our view.0;136;0c
