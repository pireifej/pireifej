I. Warm-Up: "Brain Ping-Pong" (10 Minutes)
Goal: Wake up the brain and stop overthinking. Speed is key.
The Game: Stand in a circle.
The Rules:
The Teacher starts by throwing an imaginary ball (or a real foam ball) to a student and saying ONE word (e.g., "Spatula").
The student catches it and immediately throws it to someone else saying the first word that connects to it (e.g., "Pancakes").
Next student: "Syrup." Next: "Sticky." Next: "Glue."
The Lesson: "If you paused to think of the 'perfect' word, the game slowed down. Impromptu speaking is about trusting your first thought!"

II. The "Cheat Codes" (3 Frameworks) (15 Minutes)
Goal: Teach them that they don't need to write a speech; they just need a structure to hang their words on.
Explain: "When a video game level is too hard, sometimes you use a Cheat Code. In speaking, we use Frameworks. If I ask you a question, don't panic. Just pick a code."
Cheat Code #1: The O.R.E.O. (Best for "Opinion" Questions)
Use this when asked: "Do you like X?" or "What is your favorite...?"
O - Opinion: State clearly how you feel. ("I think Minecraft is the best game ever.")
R - Reason: Why? ("Because you can build anything you can imagine.")
E - Example: Give a specific detail. ("Once, I built a castle that went all the way to the clouds.")
O - Opinion: Restate it. ("That is why Minecraft is the king of games.")
Cheat Code #2: The Time Traveler (Best for "Tell us about..." Questions)
Use this for big topics or history.
Past: How was it before? ("In the past, school lunches were just boring sandwiches.")
Present: How is it now? ("Today, we have pizza Fridays and salad bars.")
Future: What do you hope happens? ("In the future, I hope we have robot waiters serving sushi!")
Example 1: The "Tech" Answer (World History)
The Question: "Tell us about how we listen to music."
The Framework Answer:
PAST: "In the past, my parents told me they had to carry around giant boomboxes or CD players that skipped every time they walked. They could only carry like 12 songs at a time!"
PRESENT: "Today, I have Spotify on my phone. I have 10 million songs in my pocket and I can listen to anything I want, anytime, instantly."
FUTURE: "In the future, I bet we won't even need headphones. The music will just be beamed directly to a chip in our ear, or maybe walls will play music automatically when we walk into a room."
Example 2: The "Personal" Answer (My Life)
This is often easier for kids because they don't need to know history facts.
The Question: "Tell us about your time at this school."
The Framework Answer:
PAST: "When I started here in Kindergarten, I was terrified. The hallways felt huge, I couldn't tie my shoes, and my biggest worry was nap time."
PRESENT: "Now that I am in 5th grade, I know where every classroom is. I play soccer at recess, and I'm learning complex math."
FUTURE: "In the future, when I graduate from here, I hope to leave a legacy as the best soccer goalie this school has ever seen."

Cheat Code #3: The Story Sandwich (Best for "What would you do?" Questions)
Use this for hypothetical situations.
Top Bun (The Hook): Start with a bold statement or sound effect. ("BOOM! That’s the sound of me winning the lottery.")
The Meat (The Story): Tell the story of what you would do. ("First, I’d buy a house made of candy. Then I’d buy a jetpack...")
Bottom Bun (The Lesson): Why does this matter? ("But seriously, I would mostly help my family.")

III. Group Drill: "The Skeleton Run" (10 Minutes)
Goal: Practice OUTLINING only. Do not give the full speech. This builds the muscle of organizing thoughts quickly.
Instruction: "I am going to ask a question. You are NOT going to give a speech. You are only going to give me the Skeleton (The 3 Bones) of your answer."
Example:
Question: What is the best pet?
Student Response: "Dog. Bone 1: They cuddle. Bone 2: They protect the house. Bone 3: They play fetch."
The Drill: Go around the room fast. Give everyone a simple topic (Favorite Season, Best Candy, Worst Chore). They just state the Answer + 3 Points.
Topics: 
What is the best school lunch?
Cats vs. Dogs: Who wins?
What is the worst chore to do at home?
Is it better to be a Ninja or a Pirate?
What is the one food you would eat for the rest of your life?
Summer Vacation vs. Winter Break?
If you could have any superpower, what would it be?
What is the most annoying noise in the world?
Video Games vs. Playing Outside?
What is the best candy in the Halloween bag?

IV. The Boss Battle: Random Encounters (20 Minutes)
Goal: Full Table Topics practice using the Cheat Codes.
Take a Breath: (Remind them of the "Fear Monster" from last week—breathe to tame it).
Pick a Cheat Code: (OREO, Time Traveler, or Story).
Speak for 1 minute.

V. Cooldown & Review (5 Minutes)

Ritual: Closing circle power pose + Chant ("1, 2, 3... LEVEL UP!").
