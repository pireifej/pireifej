I. Welcome & The Great Confidence Mystery (10 Minutes)
Goal: Breaking the ice and defining what confidence actually is.
The Grocery Store Test:
Start by asking: "Raise your hand if you bought a bag of 'Confidence' at the grocery store this morning? Which aisle was it in? Frozen foods? Cereal?"
Ask: "Is confidence something you can buy? Is it something you are born with? Or is it something you build?"
What Confidence IS NOT:
Explain clearly: "Confidence doesn't mean you are perfect. It doesn't mean you never make a mistake or that you never feel nervous."
What Confidence IS:
The Definition: "Confidence is trusting yourself! It's knowing that your voice matters and that it's okay to be exactly who you are."
Discussion: "Who do you know that is confident? A YouTuber? A teacher? A superhero?"
II. The Speaker’s Toolkit: Body, Face & Breath (15 Minutes)
Goal: Physical and vocal warm-ups to get out of the head and into the body.
Body Stretch (Getting Loose):
Reach for the Sky: "Inhale and reach up as high as you can to the ceiling... now drop down."
Shoulder Rolls: "Roll your shoulders back. We carry stress in our shoulders—let it go."
The Shake Out: "Shake out your right hand, shake out your left hand. Shake out your right foot, shake out your left foot. Get the wiggles out!"
Face & Voice Yoga:
Silly Faces: "Make your face as big as a lion! Now scrunch it as small as a lemon! Stretch those face muscles."
Jaw Massage: "Take your fingers and gently massage your jaw. A tight jaw makes it hard to speak clearly."
Lip Rolls: "Take a deep breath and blow out through your lips making a horse sound or a motorboat sound: Brrrbrrrbrrr. This wakes up your voice."
Breathing Control (The Engine):
Belly Breathing: "Put one hand on your belly. When we breathe, we want the belly to move OUT, not the shoulders up."
Box Breathing: "Inhale for 4 counts... Hold for 4 counts... Exhale for 4 counts. Feel your belly move."
III. Taming the "Fear Monster" (10 Minutes)
Goal: Normalizing stage fright and learning to manage it.
Meet the Fear Monster:
The Truth: "Feeling butterflies in your stomach is normal! Even famous people and celebrities get scared before they go on stage."
Reframing: "Fear is just your body giving you extra energy to do something great. The butterflies aren't bad; we just need to make them fly in formation."
Techniques to Tame the Butterflies:
Reframe It: "When you feel that shaky feeling, tell yourself: 'I'm not nervous, I'm EXCITED!'"
Find a Friend: "Look for friendly faces in the audience who are smiling at you. Ignore the grumpy chairs."
Activity: The Power Pose:
Instruction: "We are going to stand up and take up space! Put your hands on your hips, chest out, and chin up like a Superhero."
The Challenge: "Hold this pose for 2 minutes. This tricks your brain into feeling brave. Feel the confidence growing!" (While they hold the pose, you can play upbeat music or talk about how their posture changes their mood).
IV. What’s Your Message? (5 Minutes)
Goal: Simplifying communication.
The Big Idea:
Ask: "If your audience could only remember ONE thing from your speech, what would it be?"
The Rule: Keep it simple. Keep it clear. Say it loud!
Audience Analysis: "Always ask: Who am I talking to? You talk differently to your best friend than you do to the school principal."
The "Puppy vs. Principal" Game:
The Scenario: You are saying "Hello" and asking them to sit down.
Round 1: Talk to a Puppy.
Voice: High-pitched, exaggerated, simple words. ("Hiiii buddy! Who's a good boy?! Sit! Siiiit!")
Round 2: Talk to the School Principal.
Voice: Respectful, lower pitch, formal. ("Good morning, Mr. Johnson. Please, take a seat right here.")
Lesson: We naturally change our voice to fit who is listening. Speaking to an audience is just choosing the right voice!
V. Finale: The 30-Second Spotlight (20 Minutes)
Goal: The first exposure to the 'stage' in a low-stakes environment.
The Setup:
"We are going to put it all together. You will come to the front, stand in your Power Pose, and speak to us."
The Prompt:
Your Name
One thing you are an expert at (Examples: Lego, sleeping, drawing, Minecraft, eating pizza).
The Rules:
Walk to the center.
Plant your feet (Power Pose).
Take one deep belly breath.
Deliver your lines loudly.
Audience Role: "The audience must clap like crazy for every single speaker."
VI. Closing Circle (Last 2 Minutes)
Review: Confidence is trust. Breathing controls the nerves. Power Poses make us brave.
Homework: "Notice one time this week you feel nervous, and turn it into excitement."
