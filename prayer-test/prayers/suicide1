God our Creator, you give breath to each person you made.
You treasure the gifts of each unique person.
But when life becomes a burden rather than a gift,
God of life, hold us.
When darkness strangles the will to live, when days become endless nights,
God of light, shine on us.
When no one seems to understand, when we walk and wait alone,
God of love, embrace us with your presence.
Where there is despair, bring hope; where there is shame, give value and worth;
where there is emptiness, bring fulfillment; where there is suffering in mind and
body, bring healing.
God of hope, hear our prayer for life.
