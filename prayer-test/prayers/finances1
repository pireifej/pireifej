Righteous God, I will diligently obey Your voice my God, I will observe carefully all Your commandments which You command today so that I may be set high above all nations of the earth. I praise You in advance for the financial blessings that shall come upon me and overtake me because I have obeyed Your voice, Lord. See my heart, see my faithfulness Father and please bless me as Your servant. Keep Your hand upon every aspect of my life, including my finances.
