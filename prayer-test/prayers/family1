O dear Jesus,
I humbly implore You to grant Your special graces to {{name}}'s family.
May {{gender1}} home be the shrine of peace, purity, love, labor and faith.
I beg You, dear Jesus, to protect and bless all of them, absent and present, living
and dead.

O Mary,
loving Mother of Jesus,
and our Mother,
pray to Jesus for {{name}}'s family,
for all the families of the world,
to guard the cradle of the newborn,
the schools of the young and their vocations.

Blessed Saint Joseph,
holy guardian of Jesus and Mary,
assist {{name}} by your prayers
in all the necessities of life.
Ask of Jesus that special grace
which He granted to you,
to watch over {{name}}'s home
at the pillow of the sick and the dying,
so that with Mary and with you,
heaven may find {{name}}'s family unbroken
in the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
