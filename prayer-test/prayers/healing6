"Please Lord,
my life is a mess,
let your love flow through me
and bring healing."
And like a river
cool refreshing water
you flowed through me.
Not as a gentle stream,
a rivulet of hope,
but a torrent,
sweeping debris away.
All those broken branches,
rust-encrusted items,
and accumulated debris,
which were holding back the flow
swept aside in a torrent of love,
flooding through my veins,
pouring into my heart,
filling my life.
This is healing.
